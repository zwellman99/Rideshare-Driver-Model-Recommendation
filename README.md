# Uber Ride Demand and Revenue Prediction
### Overview
This code is designed to predict the demand for Uber rides and the potential revenue generated from those rides. It uses historical Uber data, including ride fare amounts and ride counts for different hours of the day, days of the week, and months. It then applies machine learning models to predict the ride count and revenue.

### Data and Libraries
The data used in this project is the "Uber Fares Dataset" from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features such as pickup and dropoff locations, pickup times, passenger counts, and fare amounts. The code also uses several Python libraries for data processing and machine learning, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Seaborn, and Prophet.

## Workflow
### Importing Data and Libraries
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and mounting the Google Colab drive. It then downloads the "Uber Fares Dataset" from Kaggle and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame (uber_df).

### Demand Modeling
The code then proceeds to perform demand modeling. It creates features based on the pickup_datetime column, such as hour, day of the week, and month. The ride count per hour is then calculated based on these features. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets. The following machine learning models are used to predict ride demand:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
The models are evaluated based on R-squared values. The code also includes a function predict_ride_count that uses the trained XGBoost model to predict the number of rides given a particular hour group, day of the week, month, and day.

### Revenue Prediction
Next, the code proceeds to revenue prediction. It calculates the haversine distance between pickup and dropoff locations and adds it as a new column distance to the DataFrame. It then removes outliers from the fare_amount and distance columns. Additional features such as hour, day, month, and year are created based on the pickup_datetime column.

The code then trains machine learning models to predict fare amounts. Similar to demand modeling, the models used include Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The models are evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values.

The code includes a function predict_fare_amount that uses the trained XGBoost model to predict fare amount given specific features such as passenger count, hour, day of the week, month, and distance.

### Heatmap of Ride Count
The code also includes functions to create and plot a heatmap of ride counts for a given week. The heatmap displays ride counts for different hour groups and days of the week. It allows users to input a specific date, and the code will generate the heatmap for the week containing that date.

### Final Notebook Usage
Run the code cells in order, starting with importing data and libraries.
Make sure to enter your Kaggle username and API key to download the dataset.
Use the predict_ride_count and predict_fare_amount functions for individual predictions.
Use the create_matrix and plot_matrix functions to generate and plot the heatmap of ride counts for a specific week.

### Final Prediction Model Usage
Pull the Uber-Prediction folder and run RunModel.py

### Conclusion
This code provides an efficient way to predict Uber ride demand and potential revenue based on historical data. It is a valuable tool for Uber's operations and pricing strategy.
